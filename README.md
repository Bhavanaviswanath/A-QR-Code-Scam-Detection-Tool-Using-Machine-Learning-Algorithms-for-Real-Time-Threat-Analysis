## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a smart and secure *QR Code Scam Detection Tool* that utilizes *machine learning algorithms* to identify and flag potentially malicious or fraudulent QR codes in real time. The system analyzes encoded URL patterns and associated metadata to detect scams, ensuring user safety during QR interactions.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

•⁠  ⁠📷 Scan and extract data from QR codes
•⁠  ⁠🧠 Use machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to detect scam patterns
•⁠  ⁠🔐 Flag suspicious URLs and redirection behaviors
•⁠  ⁠📊 Real-time analysis with immediate threat feedback
•⁠  ⁠🌐 Optional UI using *Streamlit* or *Flask*

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

•⁠  ⁠*Python 3.10+*
•⁠  ⁠*OpenCV* – QR Code detection from images
•⁠  ⁠*Pandas, **NumPy* – Data preprocessing
•⁠  ⁠*Scikit-learn* – ML algorithms (classification)
•⁠  ⁠*Joblib* – Model serialization
•⁠  ⁠*Streamlit / Flask* – UI for real-time detection
•⁠  ⁠*Jupyter Notebook* – Analysis and model training

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.⁠ ⁠*Scan QR Code*: Extracts encoded text (usually a URL) using OpenCV or pyzbar.
2.⁠ ⁠*Preprocess Input*: Extracts URL features like domain, path length, presence of special characters, etc.
3.⁠ ⁠*Classification*: Uses a trained ML model to classify the URL as Safe or Scam.
4.⁠ ⁠*Display Result*: Shows threat level with justification (e.g., contains phishing keywords, uses URL shortener, etc.)

---

### ✅ Setup Environment

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Detection Script: python detector.py --image ./data/sample_qr.png
Launch Streamlit App: streamlit run app.py


## Sample Output 
QR Scan Result:
URL: http://bit.ly/secure-login-page
⚠️ Alert: This QR code redirects to a suspicious domain.
Threat Type: URL Shortener + Phishing Keywords
Prediction: SCAM


## Future Enhancements
🔁 Live camera QR scanning integration

🧠 Deep Learning-based scam detection (e.g., LSTM, BERT for URL)

🌍 Integration with online URL threat intelligence APIs

📱 Android/iOS App using React Native or Flutter
